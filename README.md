**Project Description**
This web app is a site for the Marketing Agency, Horiseon.
The company, which specializes in Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing needed an updated website that met accessibility standards.

For this project, I used semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure in order to make the html file easier to read and maintain. I also streamlined the CSS to be more efficient and reorganized the stylesheet so that styles were organized by which sections of the webpage they applied to (header, main body, and the aside). I updated the main articles to be a flex display so that the webpage is more dynamic and easy to read regardless of the user's screen size.  Finally, I added media queries so that the navbar collapses into a dropdown when the screensize is too small to support a navlist and so that the aside drops down beneath the main text when the screen size is that of a tablet or smaller.

**Challenges**
I worked quite a bit to make the flexbox work to best shrink and stretch with the page width.  I also had fun playing with the navbar options and trying out different semantic elements to see their effects on the page (if any). 

**Motivation**
This project's aimed to apply HTML semantic elements to make Horiseon's website accessible, maintainable, and organized.  I worked on this project to ensure that these aims were met.  In the process of building this web application, I learned about many different semantic elements and their importance in creating an easily maintained website.
